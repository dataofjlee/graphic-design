Hi Tim- I mean Mr. Barlow,

I'm Donovn, an online hero. Well, not really. I'm a graphic designer, and occassionally I like to do the ol' random act of kindness. So to clarify, I'm not looking for any money or anything in return for this.

,

I stumbled across your blog a while back, and I was amazed by all your work with creating ebooks. I mean, you've written in total, what, 500 pages? Not just written
filmed, and shaped. That's incredible! I know that the books are very high-quality, and you've made each page with special care, it's just that other people don't know this
Unfortunately, the majority of people will judge a book by it's cover, and the covers on your books just simply do not represent the professionality of them (your descriptions are great though). 
You have great reviews, but just not enough of them, and this concerned me when considering the exposure the books truly deserve. 

For a random user browsing iBooks, there's going to be a process of steps which they follow to purchase your books. First, they see the cover. If it appeals to them and makes them interested, then they will open it, read the description and view the content.
From then on, it's think it's a no-brainer to buy and read. Like I mentioned before, I don't think your book covers are 'appealing' enough, but you've got all the other steps down.

Anyway, I know that you created your books out of true passion, and don't really want to pour too money/effort much into them, so I made these for you. I feel like they are the missing pieces.

So, enough rambling on. Here they are!
(All the images I've used are free for commercial use so don't stress, and I've tried to keep them as similar as possible to the orginal ones!).



Please feel free to email me back if you want to make any minor changes to them.
