In collaboration with a childhood best friend, in the living room during a family BBQ, on a mother's hijacked laptop, falling in love with programming for the very first time, one `GO TO` at a time...

## Environment Compatibility 🌐

This script is a Batch file (`*.bat`), designed to run in the Windows Command Prompt environment. It leverages native commands like `@echo off`, `color`, `title`, and `cls`, which are specific to Windows' Command-Line Interface (CLI).

### Key Points 📌
- **OS**: Windows only 🪟
- **Shell**: Command Prompt ⚙️
- **Not Compatible With**: UNIX-like systems such as macOS and Linux 🍎🐧

For users on non-Windows systems looking to execute this script, consider using a Windows emulator or rewriting the script to suit your system's native shell scripting language (e.g., Bash for macOS/Linux).
